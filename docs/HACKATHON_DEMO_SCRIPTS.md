🎬 Demo Scenario: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain

💬 You: "I need to build a pharmaceutical supply chain system for FDA compliance"

🤖 APIX AI: "I'll help you create an FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliant pharmaceutical 
supply chain system. Let me analyze your requirements:

✅ Industry: Pharmaceutical  
✅ Regulation: FDA 21 CFR Part 11  
✅ Use Case: Supply chain traceability  

I recommend this Hedera architecture:
🔹 HCS (Consensus Service) - Immutable audit trails for FDA compliance
🔹 HTS (Token Service) - Drug serialization and batch tracking  
🔹 Smart Contracts - Automated compliance validation
🔹 File Service - Secure document storage with integrity verification

This ensures:
• Complete drug traceability from manufacture to patient
• Tamper-proof audit trails for FDA inspections  
• Automated compliance reporting
• Real-time quality control alerts

Would you like me to generate this implementation? [Y/n]"

💬 You: "Yes, generate the code with Next.js and TypeScript"

🤖 APIX AI: "Generating FDA-compliant pharmaceutical supply chain system...

🏗️ Architecture Components:
