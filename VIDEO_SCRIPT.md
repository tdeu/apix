**Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025 | Developer Tools & Infrastructure Track**

---

## üé¨ Video Requirements

- **Duration:** Maximum 3 minutes (180 seconds)
- **Format:** High resolution (1080p minimum), clear audio
- **Platform:** YouTube or Vimeo with public link
- **Critical:** Must show live Hedera transaction with HashScan verification

---

## üìã Complete Video Script (Time-Coded)

### üéØ Section 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:15) - 15 seconds

**ON SCREEN:**
- Simple title slide with APIX logo/name
- Team name
- "Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025 | Developer Tools Track"

**WHAT TO SAY:**
```
"Hi, I'm [Your Name] from [Team Name]. We're competing in the Developer
Tools & Infrastructure track with APIX AI - the intelligent CLI that
transforms Hedera integration from 8 hours to 90 seconds.

Here's the problem: African developers face critical barriers adopting
Hedera - steep learning curves, 60% integration failure rates, and 200+
pages of fragmented documentation."
```

**TIMING NOTES:**
- Speak clearly and confidently
- Practice to stay within 15 seconds
- Smile and maintain energy

---

### üí° Section 2: Product Overview (0:15 - 0:45) - 30 seconds

**ON SCREEN:**
- Quick screen recording showing:
  1. Terminal with `apix --help` output (2 seconds)
  2. Running `apix analyze` in a Next.js project (3 seconds)
  3. Flash through generated files in VS Code (3 seconds)
  4. Show a completed React component with Hedera integration (2 seconds)

**WHAT TO SAY:**
```
"APIX is an AI-powered CLI that solves this. Watch: I run 'apix analyze'
in any React or Next.js project. The AI detects my framework, analyzes
my structure, and suggests optimal Hedera integrations.

Then, one command - 'apix add hts' - generates 8 production-ready files:
TypeScript wrappers, React hooks, API routes, wallet integration, and
complete UI components. All type-safe, all production-ready, in under
90 seconds.

Why does this matter? Hedera's $0.0001 fixed fees make developer
education sustainable - we can demonstrate 100 operations for just
one cent in HBAR. Perfect for African developers with limited budgets."
```

**SCREEN RECORDING TIPS:**
- Record at 1080p resolution
- Clean up terminal (clear history, nice prompt)
- Use syntax highlighting in VS Code
- Speed up boring parts (2x speed, then slow for key moments)

---

### üöÄ Section 3: Live Hedera Demo (0:45 - 2:45) - 2 MINUTES ‚ö° **MOST IMPORTANT**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This section MUST show live blockchain interaction + HashScan verification**

#### Part A: Setup & Token Creation (0:45 - 1:30) - 45 seconds

**ON SCREEN:**
- Terminal ready with a clean Next.js project
- Show .env file with test credentials (blur the private key!)

**WHAT TO SAY:**
```
"Now, let me show you live blockchain integration. I'm starting with a
fresh Next.js project. I'll create a real token on Hedera Testnet.

[Type in terminal]
apix add hts --name 'AfricaToken' --symbol 'AFR'

Watch as APIX generates all the integration files... Done! 8 files created
in 12 seconds. Now let's create a real token on Hedera.

[Type in terminal]
apix create-token --name 'AfricaToken' --symbol 'AFR' --supply 1000000
```

**SCREEN RECORDING TIPS:**
- Type commands slowly and clearly
- Let the progress spinners show (looks professional)
- When files are generated, quickly show the file tree
- Don't rush - 45 seconds is enough time

#### Part B: Transaction Success & HashScan (1:30 - 2:15) - 45 seconds

**ON SCREEN:**
- Terminal shows transaction success with token ID
- **IMMEDIATELY** switch to browser with HashScan open

**WHAT TO SAY:**
```
"There it is! Transaction successful. Token ID: 0.0.xxxxxx

Now, the critical part - let me verify this on HashScan, Hedera's
blockchain explorer.

[Switch to browser - HashScan testnet already open]
[Navigate to: hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.YOUR_TOKEN_ID]

And here it is - live on the Hedera testnet! You can see:
- Token ID: 0.0.xxxxxx
- Name: AfricaToken
- Symbol: AFR
- Supply: 1,000,000
- Transaction timestamp
- And it cost us exactly $0.0001 - one ten-thousandth of a dollar.

This is real blockchain verification, happening in real-time."
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS PART:**
1. ‚úÖ Show the actual token creation transaction
2. ‚úÖ Copy the token ID from terminal
3. ‚úÖ Open HashScan in browser (have it ready in another tab)
4. ‚úÖ Show the live token on HashScan with:
   - Token ID clearly visible
   - Token name and symbol
   - Supply amount
   - Transaction timestamp
5. ‚úÖ Point out the $0.0001 transaction cost

**FILMING TIPS:**
- Have HashScan already open in another browser tab
- Practice the token ID copy-paste transition
- If live demo fails, have a backup recording ready
- Keep mouse movements smooth and deliberate
- Zoom in slightly if needed for clarity

#### Part C: Generated Code Quick Tour (2:15 - 2:45) - 30 seconds

**ON SCREEN:**
- Switch to VS Code showing generated files
- Quickly show 2-3 key files

**WHAT TO SAY:**
```
"Let me quickly show you what APIX generated. Here's the TypeScript
wrapper for all HTS operations - type-safe, fully documented.

Here's the React hook for token management - useState, error handling,
loading states - all production-ready.

And here's the complete TokenManager component - ready to drop into
any Next.js application.

All of this, generated in 90 seconds. No manual configuration. No
copy-pasting from docs. Just intelligent, production-ready code."
```

**SCREEN RECORDING TIPS:**
- Open 3 key files: hts-operations.ts, useTokenOperations.ts, TokenManager.tsx
- Scroll slowly through each file (5-8 seconds per file)
- Highlight key features with mouse or cursor
- Code should be properly formatted and clean

### üéØ Section 4: Conclusion (2:45 - 3:00) - 15 seconds

**ON SCREEN:**
- Simple closing slide with:
  - "APIX AI"
  - "Hedera integration in 90 seconds"
  - GitHub repo URL
  - Contact info

**WHAT TO SAY:**
```
"APIX transforms Hedera integration from 8 hours to 90 seconds. We're
using Hedera's ABFT finality for real-time developer feedback, and
fixed $0.0001 fees for sustainable education in African markets.

Built with the Hedera SDK, Agent Kit, and production-ready templates.
Thank you!"
```

**TIMING NOTES:**
- End exactly at or before 3:00 minutes
- Leave 2-3 seconds of silence at the end for fade-out

## üé¨ Sample Script Variations

### If You're Nervous About Speaking

**Alternative Approach:**
- Record the demo silently first
- Add voice-over narration afterwards
- This allows you to:
  - Perfect the demo without worrying about speaking
  - Re-record voice easily if you make mistakes
  - Match timing precisely to visuals

### If English Isn't Your First Language

**Tips:**
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Write out the script and practice 10 times
- Consider adding English subtitles
- Focus on clarity over speed
- Short sentences are better than long ones

### If You're Camera Shy

**No Problem!**
- You don't need to show your face
- Screen recording only is perfectly fine
- Professional voice-over is enough
- Many winning demos are screen-only

---

## üìä Judging Criteria Focus

When creating your video, remember judges are evaluating:

1. **Technical Execution (35%)** - Show real blockchain integration
2. **Innovation (25%)** - Emphasize AI-powered automation and 90-second integration
3. **Problem-Solution Fit (20%)** - Stress African market challenges
4. **Demo Quality (20%)** - Professional, clear, under 3 minutes

---

## üéâ You've Got This!

**Final Tips:**
- Practice 3-5 times before final recording
- Time yourself with a stopwatch
- Test everything the morning of recording
- Stay calm - you can always re-record
- Show confidence - your tool is amazing!

**Remember:** The goal is to show judges that APIX works, it's innovative, and it solves a real problem. The demo is your proof.
